## Lesson Recap
In this lesson you learned how to use Kafka Connect to quickly integrate Kafka into a number of your existing data stores and workflows. We went hands-on with the JDBC and FileStream connectors and saw how to configure and deploy them. Next, we saw how REST Proxy can be used to bring Kafka to applications that canâ€™t integrate native clients, but do have REST capabilities.

##Glossary of Key Terms in this Lesson: (same as provided in beginning of lesson)

- Kafka Connect - A web server and framework for integrating Kafka with external data sources such as SQL databases, log files, and HTTP endpoints.

- JAR - Java ARchive. Used to distribute Java code reusably in a library format under a single file.

- Connector - A JAR built on the Kafka Connect framework which integrates to an external system to either source or sink data from Kafka

- Source - A Kafka client putting data into Kafka from an external location, such as a data store

- Sink - A Kafka client remove data from Kafka into an external location, such as a data store

- JDBC - Java Database Connectivity. A Java programming abstraction over SQL database interactions.

- Task - Responsible for actually interacting with and moving data within a Kafka connector. One or more tasks make up a connector.

- Kafka REST Proxy - A web server providing APIs for producing and consuming from Kafka, as well as fetching cluster metadata.
